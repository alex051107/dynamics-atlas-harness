One important corollary of the fact that LLMs cannot self-
critique their plans is that they also can’t self-improve by
generating synthetic data, e.g. by generating plans them-
selves, critiquing the plans by themselves to improve them,
and then using those to fine-tune themselves, as has been
claimed in the literature (Huang et al., 2023b; Wang et al.,

2.3. Analyzing Claims to the Contrary in the Literature
Given that LLMs can neither guarantee correct generation
nor correct verification of plans, as discussed in the previous
sections, one obvious question is why the literature is replete
with claims contrary to this (Bairi et al., 2023; Yao et al.,               Figure 2. Viewing LLMs as an approximate knowledge source
