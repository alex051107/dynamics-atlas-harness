diate reasoning steps of free-form text. In contrast, Program-aided Language models (PA L, right) generate intermediate
steps and Python code. This shifts the role of running the reasoning steps from the language model to the Python interpreter.
The final answer is obtained by running the generated reasoning chain. Chain-of-thought reasoning is highlighted in blue ;
PA L steps are highlighted in gray and pink ; the Python interpreter run is highlighted in black and green .

A. Alternative Prompts without Meaningful Variable Names

   a = 23
   b = 5
   c = 3
   d = b * c
   e = a - d
   print(e)

                     (a) Structured explanation with uninformative variable names (PA L - var)
   # Olivia has $23
   a = 23
   # number of bagels bought
   b = 5
   # price of each bagel
   c = 3
   # total price of bagels
   d = b * c
   # money left
   e = a - d
   print(e)

          (b) Structured explanation with uninformative variable names, but useful comments (PA L - var + comms)
   money initial = 23
   bagels = 5
   bagel cost = 3
   money spent = bagels * bagel cost
   money left = money initial - money spent
   result = money left
   print(result)

                                                       (c) PA L prompts

$3 each. How much money does she have left? Uninformative variable names (left), Uninformative variable names with
useful comments (left), and PA L. Including text description


                             Setting       C OT     PA L - var    PA L - var + comms       PA L
                             Solve Rate    63.1     59.0          69.0                     71.8

Table 4: Role of text: including text either as informative variable names (PA L) or comments is important (PA L - var +
comms). Uninformative variable names PA L - var cause a drastic drop in performance, indicating that just structure is not
sufficient. The corresponding prompts are shown in Figure 10.

For mathematical problems, since our standard prompts do not use much comment, we start by creating alternative prompts
where the informative variable names are replaced with single-letters (Figure 10). The results in Table 4 shows a considerable
performance drop: from an average of 71.8% to 59%. Note that the ablation where structured outputs are completely
removed in favor of purely text explanations is precisely the C OT setting, which achieves a solve rate of 63%. These results
underscore the importance of text but more importantly show that combining both text and procedural statements leads to
higher performance gains—either is sub-optimal.

B. Additional analysis on Arithmetic Reasoning
GSM-hard with hard prompts The GSM - HARD experiments used prompts that were sampled from the GSM 8 K training
set. Will C OT be helped by using larger numbers in the prompts as well? To investigate this, we create prompts where the
numbers are changed to larger numbers, matching the distribution of numbers in GSM - HARD. The results in Table 5 shows
                                          PAL: Program-aided Language Models                                                14

that even with a prompt that matches the numbers, there are only modest gains in performance. These results show that the
gains achieved by using code-based reasoning chains may not be achieved simply by using better few-shot examples for
C OT.

                                          Regular Prompt      Prompt with Larger Numbers
                                  C OT           23.3                      23.8

                   Table 5: GSM-hard results, when the prompts also had examples of larger numbers.


Succinct Code The programs used in few-shot examples by PA L are multi-step, and show a step-by-step breakdown of
the reasoning process. Is this breakdown necessary? Alternatively, can we return a single line expression (see Figure 11b) to
calculate the result? Results in Table 6 (4th row) shows that is not the case. With single-line expressions, the performance of
PA L falls to the level of direct prompting.

Generating the answer directly PA L first generates a reasoning chain in the form of a Python program, and passes the
generated program to a runtime to obtain an answer. Is PA L better only because of the program-style intermediate reasoning
chains, or are the improvements derived from offloading execution to the Python runtime? To investigate this, we experiment
with a variant that forces the LLM to generate the answer after generating the reasoning chain (Figure 11e). This setting
compels the LLM to condition on the generated code-based reasoning to generate an answer, simulating the runtime. The
results in Table 6 (5th row) show that the solve rate drops to near D IRECT levels. This reinforces our hypothesis that while
current LLMs can be excellent at specifying a high-level plan to solve a task—they are still incapable of executing them.

C. Effect of Using Language Models of Code
In our experiments, we focused on evaluating the performance of a language model for code. We aimed to investigate
whether the additional performance boost observed in our results was due to the use of models like Codex, or whether our
formulation was useful even for text-based models. To this end, we conducted additional experiments using text-based
language models. Our findings indicate that the PAL approach is not restricted to working solely with Codex, but can also
be applied to natural language (NL) models, as long as the model is sufficiently strong. Specifically, our results showed that
in the text-davinci-001 model, the use of the CoT approach resulted in better performance.

D. Analyzing the Effect of Increasing Number of Samples on PA L
In Section 5.1, we show that PA L outperforms strong baselines both for a single sample and by drawing 40 samples and
using majority voting. Figure 12 illustrates the trends for cases when the number of samples drawn are between 1 and 40,
and the interpolation estimates demonstrate that PA L remains competitive throughout the number of samples.

E. Standard Deviations Across Multiple Order of Prompts
For each math reasoning task, we run inference using three random orderings of the prompts. As shown in Table 7, the
standard deviation between the results obtained from the three different seeds is minimal.

F. PA L Beyond Benchmarks
We argue that symbolic reasoning is a crucial component in solving a wide range of tasks. In this section, we demonstrate
examples of tasks that may not initially appear to require using programs as intermediate reasoning steps, but can be
improved through the use of PA L-style reasoning. We demonstrate these examples using the ChatGPT tool.1 In contrast to
the in-context-learning methods we used in the main paper, here we instruct ChatGPT to perform program-aided reasoning
through one of the user utterances.
In Figure 13, in C OT-style reasoning, while the reasoning chain is correct, the final answer is wrong. In contrast, PA L-style
reasoning could not only accurately extract the color of objects from the question but also produce the correct lines of code
to branch to different situations that yield their corresponding correct answers.
A more intriguing example is letting an LLM count the number of letters in the word “intriguing”. In Figure 14a, while the
step-by-step explanation appears reasonable by splitting the letters by spaces, ChatGPT does not change the answer after
this explicit reasoning and insists on the wrong answer. Explicitly instructing the model to perform step-by-step reasoning
before answering the question still yields the wrong answer. In contrast, PA L-style reasoning only takes a few lines of code,
and the execution does produce the correct answer, in this case. These examples indicate that PA L can benefit even an
ostensibly powerful model like ChatGPT.

(a) Step-by-step reasoning struggle on counting the number of letters in the word “intrigu-
ing” which has ten letters.




(b) Explicitly instructing ChatGPT to reason step-by-step before generating answer still
leads to the wrong answer.




 (c) PA L takes a few lines of code and the execution could result in the correct answer.

G. Closer Look into Token-level Behaviors of Different Mechanisms
Beyond empirical results, we make initial attempts to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of LLMs with different
reasoning mechanisms by looking into the token-level log-likelihood of reasoning chains produced by C OT and PA L.
We randomly selected 20 questions from the COLORED OBJECTS dataset, along with their corresponding C OT and PA L
solutions. We then manually compared the two mechanisms by focusing on tokens with a low log-likelihood.
Our analysis reveals that C OT often has lower confidence in tokens related to numbers and quantitative information, the
grounded position of spatial adjectives (e.g., right-most), properties such as the color of objects, and nouns that refer to the
objects. Specifically, we found that this occurred in seven, six, two, and six examples out of the 20 we examined. In contrast,
PA L uses list manipulations, such as len(objects), and accesses objects and their associated properties through list
indexing (e.g., object[3][0]). We found that the LLM is typically confident in producing these programs. Furthermore,
we observed that while C OT requires different expressions for the same concept in different contexts, PA L almost always
uses the same expression, which is presumably more robust. For example, when there are five objects, C OT predicts “the
right-most thing is the fifth item on the list”, and “the right-most thing is the third item on the list” when the number of
objects is three. Occasionally, C OT also predicts “the right-most thing is last item on the list” which does not provide more
concrete information. On the contrary, PA L confidently predicts objects[-1] consistently. The more consistent and
uniform use of expressions in PA L can be attributed to the explicit and defined nature of programming languages, which
allows for clear and accurate expressions.

H. Datasets
In the following tables (Table 8,Table 9, Table 10), we presents statistics and examples for the datasets we considered.

   Dataset                               N        Example
   Reasoning about Colored Objects       2000     On the table, you see a bunch of objects arranged in a row: a purple

H.1. Creating GSM - HARD
While replacing numbers in the question is easy using pattern matching, a more challenging aspect is recalculating the correct
answer. GSM 8 K evaluation set contains 1319 samples, which is prohibitively expensive to perform manual re-calculation.
Instead, we leverage PA L to assist obtaining the correct answers. For 71% of the examples where PA L is correct on
GSM 8 K , we utilize the generated program and replace the initial value with the larger values. For example, if we create
a harder version of the problem in Figure 3 by replacing $23 dollars with $15687 dollars, we correspondingly replace
money initial=23 to money initial=15678. Running the program could automatically produce the correct
answer of the harder question. Notably, this annotation process assumes that a program that produces a correct answer to
a GSM 8 K question indicates the correctness of the program itself. While this is not guaranteed due to possible spurious
correlations, we manually checked 25 programs and found all of them are correct. For the incorrect 29% of the cases, we
run PA L again and perform nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019) with temperature 0.7, and repeat the above process if
any correct solution is found. Finally, the authors manually annotate the correct answer for 50 remaining cases that PA L was
not able to solve after 100 iterations.

H.2. GSM - HARD Analysis
Table 11 shows thoughts generated with C OT on GSM 8 K and GSM - HARD. A manual analysis reveals that a majority of the
generated thoughts (16/25) were identical for GSM 8 K and GSM - HARD, indicating that larger numbers primarily diminish
performance due to failure of LLM to do arithmetic..

I. Generalization of PAL to Least-to-Most Prompting

   Q: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently
   ,→  twice 30 years old, how old is Kody?
   A: To answer the question "How old is Kody?", we need to know: "How old is Mohamed?",
   ,→  "How old was Mohamed four years ago?", "How old was Kody four years ago?".

                                (a) Least-to-Most Math Reducing Prompt
   Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice
   ,→  30 years old, how old is Kody?

   Q: How old was Mohamed four years ago?
   A: We were told that Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, so he is currently 30 *
   ,→  2 = 60 years old. That means that four years ago he must have been 60 - 4 = 56
   ,→  years old. The answer is 56.

   Q: How old is Kody?
   A: Four years ago, Kody was half as old as Mohamed, so Kody must have been 56 / 2 =
   ,→  28 years old then. Since Kody was 28 years old four years ago, she must now be 28
   ,→  + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.

                                (b) Least-to-Most Math Solving Prompt
   # Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice
       30 years old, how old is Kody?

   # How old was Mohamed four years ago?
   mohamed_age_current = 30 * 2
   mohamed_age_4_years_ago = mohamed_age_current - 4

   # Final Question: How old is Kody?
   kody_age_4_years_ago = mohamed_age_4_years_ago / 2
   kody_age_current = kody_age_4_years_ago + 4
   answer = kody_age_current

Previous experiments focus on the C OT technique. This section examines if PA L generalizes to other prompt types. We
consider a strong alternative prompting strategy L EAST- TO -M OST (Zhou et al., 2022). L EAST- TO -M OST solves problems
in two stages, problem-reducing and problem-solving. Problem reducing stage turns the problem into sub-problems, and
the solving stage solves them sequentially. It keeps two prompts, each for an individual stage. To patch L EAST- TO -M OST
prompts with PA L, we adopt a simple and straightforward approach: we note that problem reduction requires logically
thinking in NL while solving requires the precision that PL offers. We therefore keep the original reducing prompts while
only turning solution segments in the solving scripts in PL. We show an example reducing prompt, original solving prompt,
and PA L solving prompt in Figure 15. Note that one unique property of PA L solving can naturally use previous questions’
answers as the symbol values are shared. In comparison, the original solving script needs to explicitly re-cite answers from
previous answers.

For our analysis, we consider the Math data sets GSM 8 K, and SVAMP as Zhou et al. (2022) found Least-to-Most helps solve
complex math problems. We patch the GSM 8 K prompt from the Zhou et al. (2022) into PA L. Note that the other tasks in

Zhou et al. (2022), like “concatenating last letters” from several words, require simple routines and are trivially solvable by
PA L. We experiment with subsets of 500 examples and record results in Table 12. Here we see PA L can take advantage of
the problem decomposition offered by the L EAST- TO -M OST reducing and further leverage the arithmetic capability in the
Python runtime to achieve additional performance gains.

K. Success and Failure Modes in Symbolic Tasks
K.1. Colored Objects

   # Find non-gold items to the right of the pencil
   non_gold = [object for object in objects[i+1:] if object[1] != 'gold']

                               (a) Snippet of PA L doing a filter operation.
   # Remove all pink objects
   non_pink = [object for object in objects if object[1] != 'pink']

   # Count number of crayons
   crayons = [object for object in non_pink if object[0] == 'crayon']
   answer = len(crayons)

                                        (b) Snippet of PA L composing multiple operations.

                     Figure 23: Example model generation snippets on Reasoning about Color Object.

By manually examining the the model outputs, we observe that PA L often performs better on questions that involve counting
objects that satisfy one or several conditions. For example, C OT fails in the following example: “On the desk, you see a
bunch of items arranged in a row: a gold textbook, a purple puzzle, a teal necklace, and a silver pencil. How many non-gold
items do you see to the right of the pencil?”. With pure NL reasoning, a LLM can easily lose track of the objects and output
the wrong answer of “The number of non-gold items to the right of the pencil is two. So the answer is two.”
In comparison, PA L is able to accurately construct the object lists with correct order and attributes. Further, it can precisely
leverage the simple yet complete PL syntax: it composes routines with functional operators from elementary builtin
operation/operators. Figure 4 lists the last a few lines of the solution to the question described above generated by PA L,
which perform filtering over objects. PA L can further compose such operations across multiple reasoning steps as shown in
Figure 23b, where it first filters out all pink objects and then scans the remaining to count crayons. Other reasoning such as
“how many objects are left after filtering” can be easily tackled precisely with an runtime.

K.2. Penguins in a Table

   ...This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard
   ,→  is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.Now, we add James
   ,→  to this table: James is 12 years old. We then delete the penguin named Bernard
   ,→  from the table.The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
   ,→  There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is 2.
   ...
   # Delete penguin Bernard.
   penguins = [penguin for penguin in penguins if penguin[0] != 'Bernard']
   # Find penguins under 8 years old.
   penguins_under_8_years_old = [penguin for penguin in penguins if penguin[1] < 8]
   # Count number of perguins under 8.
   num_penguin_under_8 = len(penguins_under_8_years_old)
   answer = num_penguin_under_8

Figure 24: Generated Snippets for one question (...We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table. How many
penguins are less than 8 years old?) in Penguins in a Table
                                                            .

In this task, we found a typical failure mode of the language is its inability to stably tracks states in its past generation.
Figure 24 lists the generations of C OT and PA L to the question that contains the removal of a penguin (“...We then delete
the penguin named Bernard from the table. How many penguins are less than 8 years old?”). Although C OT picks up the
critical information that “penguins that are less then 8 years old are Louis and Bernard”, and that “Bernard is deleted”. It
still fails to aggregate the information properly and infer that there is one penguin less then 8 left in the end. In comparison,
PA L expresses this dynamic through manipulating a penguins list by filtering out the penguin whose name is “Bernard”,
                                        PAL: Program-aided Language Models                                            34

and maintaining a penguins under 8 years old list. It offloads tracking exact the values (in this case, the length of
the list) to the deterministic Python runtime.

K.3. Date Understanding

   Q: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old
   ,→  birthday. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?

   A: The last day of February is the 28th, so Jane was born on 02/28/2001. Today is her
   ,→  16-year old birthday, so today is 02/28/2017. So 24 hours later is 02/29/2017. So
   ,→  the answer is 02/29/2017.

   # Q: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old
       birthday. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?
   # If Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001 and today is her 16-year-old
       birthday, then today is 16 years later.
   today = datetime(2001, 2, 28) + relativedelta(years=16)
   # 24 hours later,
   later = today + relativedelta(hours=24)
   # The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
   later.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')

                             Figure 25: Example model generation on Date Understanding.

We found this especially common when the time deltas are across the month boundary. We show an example in Figure 25.
Here with C OT prompting, the LLM expresses the knowledge of the 28-day-long February, yet it still outputs 02/29/2017 as
the final answer. With PA L, the actual calendar is accurate as a program handles the operation.
